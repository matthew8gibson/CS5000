Program #1 (25 points): Write a Java program, named StringMethods, which reads from the user two strings (say string_1, and string_2). 

Do not hardcode the inputs, allow the user to enter any name. 

The
program uses String class methods to manipulate these input strings as follows and prints out the outcome as shown below.
a) Determine the length of string_1.
b) Determine the length of string_2.
c) Concatenate both strings, separated by space.
d) Check if the two strings have same set of characters with regard to case (i.e., equal).
e) Convert string_1 to upper case.
f) Convert string_2 to lower case.
g) Extract a valid sub-string of multiple characters from string_1.

Make sure to properly label your output prompts for each manipulation above and print the outputs on separate lines. Use the escape character (\t) to line-up the outputs after the labels as follows (for inputs: John and Amy):

a) Length of String 1:
b) Length of String 2:
c) Concatenation:
d) Equal Strings?
e) Uppercase String 1:
f) Lowercase String 2:
g) Valid substring:

4 characters
3 characters
John Amy
Not equal
JOHN
amy oh

Make sure your code displays the outputs following the test data format. Separate your code into sections with proper in-line comment before each section, such as
   // Part A: Determine the length of string_1

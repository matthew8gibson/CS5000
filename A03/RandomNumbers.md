Program #2 (25 points): Write a Java program, named RandomNumbers, that generates random numbers as follows.

a) A random integer number between 20 and 80 (inclusive).
b) A random integer number between -20 and 20 (inclusive).
c) A random integer number between -50 and -20 (inclusive).
d) A random floating-point number between 0.0 and 21.9999 (inclusive).

Properly label output for each part above, print the outputs on separate lines, and use the tab escape character (\t) to line-up the outputs after the labels as shown in this sample run:

a) A random integer between 20 and 80 (inclusive): 51
b) A random integer between -20 and 20 (inclusive): -9
c) A random integer between -50 and -20 (inclusive): -39
d) A random float between 0.0 and 21.9999 (inclusive): 19.9048

Make sure your code displays the outputs following the test data format. Separate your code into sections with proper in-line comments such as
// Part A: Generate random integer number between 20 and 80 (inclusive)

my almost question: 
Given the word 'inclusive' in the requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;

like here for example: "a) A random integer number between 20 and 80 (inclusive)"

If I look at the functions from our slides to do random, it has this description: "Generates a random double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0 (0.0 &lt;= Math.random() &lt; 1.0)".&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think that means the Math.random function is inclusive at 0.0, but exclusive at 1.0. If I'm reading it correctly, then there is a gap in this function allowing us to meet these requirements given this function.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, do we 'accept' this miss or do we look at other ideas (like other Java methods)? I was&nbsp;

Thanks!

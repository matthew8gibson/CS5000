 Write a Java program, named BestAppleDeal, 
 
 to determine the best deal 
when buying a small box of apples vs. a large box of apples. 

The program asks the user to enter the weight and price of each box 

and then determines which box has the best better value. 

The boxes may 
have the same value. 

Sample runs are shown below. Document your code, and properly label the input 
prompts and the outputs. Use escape character (\t) to format the outputs as shown below. 

Sample test 
data below does not show the input prompts. Make sure your code displays the outputs following the test 
data format.

First test:
Small box weight: 5 Pounds 
Small box price: 10 Dollars 
Large box weight: 12 Pounds
Large box prices: 18 Dollars 
Judgment: The large box is a better deal

Second test:
Small box weight: 5 Pounds 
Small box price: 10 Dollars 
Large box weight: 8 Pounds
Large box prices: 16 Dollars 
Judgment: Both boxes are of the same value

Third test:
Small box weight: 5 Pounds 
Small box price: 10 Dollars 
Large box weight: 10 Pounds
Large box prices: 28 Dollars 
Judgment: The smaller box is a better deal

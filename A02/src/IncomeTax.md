Program #1 (17 points): Write a Java program, named IncomeTax, that reads annual income from the 
user (as integer value) and then, on separate lines, prints out the entered income amount along with the 
tax bracket (using the following tax table) followed by the tax amount: 
 Annual income <= $30,000 tax bracket: 3% 
$30,000 < Annual income <= $70,000 tax bracket: 10% 
$70,000 < Annual income <= $150,000 tax bracket: 15% 
$150,000 < Annual income <= $300,000 tax bracket: 20%
$300,000 < Annual income <= $900,000 tax bracket: 35% 
$900,000 < Annual income tax bracket: 40% 
Make sure to properly label your output, format the output (using $ and %), and use escape character (\t) 
to line-up the outputs after the labels as shown below. Document your code; and organize and properly 
space out the outputs. For the sample output below, notice that the tax calculation is 30k at 3%, 40k at 
10%, and 50k at 15% (that is, $900+$4,000+$7,500). The sample test data below does not show the 
input prompts. Make sure your code displays the outputs following the test data format.
Your income: $120000
Your tax bracket: 15%
Your tax amount: $12400

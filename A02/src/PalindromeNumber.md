Program #2 (17 points): 

The concept of a 5-digits palindrome number is that its digits read the same 
from left to right and from right to left. For example, 12121, 45454, 14741, etcâ€¦ 

Write a java program, 
named PalindromeNumber, that reads a 5-digit number from the user (as integer value) 

and then 
determines whether the entered number is a palindrome or not. (Do not use loops or treat the entered 
number as string of characters). Manipulate the input number mathematically using proper math 
operators (division and remainder) to determine if it is a palindrome or not. 

An input of less than or greater 
than 5 digits should be rejected as invalid input before being processed. Document your code, use proper 
label for the input prompt (e.g., Please enter a 5-digits integer value:), 

and display the 
outputs similar to the following examples. Use escape character (\t) to line up the outputs after the labels 
as shown below. 

Sample test data below does not show the input prompts. Make sure your code displays 
the outputs following the test data format.

First test:
Input value: 122
Judgment: Invalid input, must be 5 digits number.

Second test:
Input value: 14127
Judgment: Not Palindrome

Third test:
Input value: 94249
Judgment: Palindrome

Fourth test:
Input value: 164461
Judgment: Invalid input, must be 5 digits number.
